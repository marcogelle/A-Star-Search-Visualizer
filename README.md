# Search-Visualizer
Required software: Python 3

To run the program: run GUI.py, located in the 'search visualizer' directory

This project aims to visualize how the A* pathfinding algorithm runs.
I used the Manhattan distance heuristic, but I plan to add options for different
heuristics (this project is still a work in progress).

I made the GUI using Tkinter for Python 3.
